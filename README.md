About Application

YUVA-Your Unofficial Virtual Assistant is a web based application to help you bring the order to the daily routine and make your life easy. 


Always ready to help you get your day in motion hassle free,  takes care of your health and medical appointments,makes suggestions regarding various modes of entertainment.
Always got your back in case of an emergency, gets you connected to the police, hospital and your close ones in no time.

 You can plan and store all the important events going to occur in future and keep a proper record.In addition and keep a check on your daily works that need to be done. You can also store your important notes in the same application with a toggle button that allows you to keep a record of complete vs incomplete work. For the enhancement of the planning part in future, we can make a calender based routine manager, that allows the usser to make a seven day schedule with a feature of being able to make different schedules for different days (e.g. different schedule for weed days and week-ends), a customized calendar can be used to show all the events in a day there, which could also inform you if any new event collides with an existing event. Also having the ability to store voice notes could also help to save time and having to-do lists allows one to keep daily tasks in order. Further, integrating SMS API could help to send out reminder messages of events to the users. 

The application also helps the customer to make medical bookings directly through the aap, saving their time and energy to visit the clinic and get an appointment and wait for their turn. You can easily make a booking in the concerned medical field. Also, we can maintain a proper record of all your medical documents within the application, abiding the need to carry your previous medical reports while going to a new doctor. For further modifications to this module, reminder features, another option for online consultancies or home visits could also be added.

IT also makes suggestions regarding various modes of entertainment for you and more could be included in future. Currently a demo for books and movies is available in the application which also provides you links for various websites from where you can access the former. Recommendation models could be built for later functioning and other categories like restaurants, hotels in near location could be merged in.

Another important feature to include would be SOS service. Emergencies never give us a knock before coming in, so better we be prepared. Currently the feature is inactive although could be of great value when in existence. In addition to a basic functionality of informing your loved ones with your current location, passing this information to the nearest police station and  hospitals could be a better saviour. However, developing a feature which enables us to track back the emergency helpers could be of great help. Such a functioning, which could allow the officials to accept the SOS request which in return sends their live location to the victim, helps the victim to see how far they have reached, this explains the above. 

Moreover, a new category of travel could be introduced into the dashboard, which could provide you facilities to book cabs automatically(I have created a python model for aumation cab booking using selenium but was not ablw to integrate to the code, hence I am unpoading it as an individual file),  help with your navigation and also you can have a better look at various other available travel modes and how you can easily make bookings. For instance, if you wish to travel somewhere by bus, the application could direct you toa bus booking option. This feature can also help me manage your train/ flight /etc. Bookings. If integrated with concerned services, for example IRCTC, you can easily check the status of your booking, train timings from the very same web application.  

To bring everything to an easy a voice assistance could be integrated to the application allowing us to navigate through the tabs and also helping us in many other ways as todayâ€™s available voice assistants.
 
It could use all cognitive faculties to ensure your life remains sorted just as your own personal assistant.
